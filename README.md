### Saving the Mypal code from Tobin.

Tobin (ab)used the Mozilla Public License to halt Mypal development and forced
Feodor2 to remove the code from his repository. So (E. R. Painter) decided to
backup the code to a new repository to ensure public accessbility of Feodor2's
work. I (Barry Nelson) decided to fork an additional copy for redundancy.
Unfortunately Feodor2 is no longer involved and I don't do much Windows
programming, so don't expect much further development here. Hopefully someone
can step up, in which case they can (and are encouraged to) download the
initial source code from here. To avoid issues, if you have any proposed
changes, please fork another copy, make your changes there, then push them to
this site, that way all changes can be automatically versioned and tracked,
eliminating any grounds for future cmplaints from Mr Tobin.

May Mypal live as long as an XP browser is wanted.
