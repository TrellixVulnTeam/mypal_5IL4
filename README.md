### Saving the Mypal code from Tobin.

Tobin (ab)used the Mozilla Public License to halt Mypal development and forced
Feodor2 to remove the code from his repository. So I (E. R. Painter) decided to backup
the code to my new repository to ensure public accessbility of Feodor2's work. Unfortunately
Feodor2 is no longer involved and I'm not even a programmer, so don't expect any
further development here. Hopefully someone can step up, in which case they can (and are encouraged to) download
the initial source code from here.

May Mypal live as long as an XP browser is wanted.
